Title: Optimizing locations for future basic social infrastructures to maximize accessibility in BARMM

Abstract
- With use of geospatial data visualization dashboards and machine learning models - particularly clustering algorithms, this project will identify optimal locations for establishing infrastructures or implementing services for educational, socioeconomic, and health purposes. Key factors to investigate are as follows: presence and nearness of existing infrastructures to residential areas, physical accessibility, i.e. road availability, and population density among others.
 We want to answer questions like:
1. Which hospitals lack accessibility to the general public?
2. What areas need more schools, hospitals and/or banks?
3. Which areas should be prioritized in improving education, socioeconomic and health status?
